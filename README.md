This is a fork of [Pluvia](https://github.com/oxters168/Pluvia), a Steam client for Android.

## How to Use

(Note that GameNative is still in its early stages, and all games may not work, or may require tweaking to get working well)

2. Install the APK on your Android device

## Building
### IF YOU JUST WANT TO USE THE APP, PLEASE SEE THE HOW TO USE SECTION ABOVE. THIS IS ONLY NEEDED IF YOU WANT TO CONTRIBUTE FOR DEVELOPMENT.
1. I use a normal build in Android studio. Hit me up if you can't figure out how to build.
2. You may need to download some additional files and place them in the `src/main/assets` folder.
These files are available on request for legitimate development purposes. Please write to me on Discord and I can share them with you there.
3. **SteamGridDB API Key (Optional):** To enable automatic fetching of game images for Custom Games, add your SteamGridDB API key to `local.properties`:
   ```
   STEAMGRIDDB_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```
   Get your API key from: https://www.steamgriddb.com/profile/preferences
   If the API key is not configured, the app will log a message but continue to work normally without fetching images.
